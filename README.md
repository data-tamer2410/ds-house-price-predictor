# House Price Predictor
This project evaluated different machine learning models for predicting real estate prices.

## Description
In this project, we analyze and compare different machine learning algorithms for predicting real estate prices. We used six models: linear regression, linear regression built from scratch, linear regression with analytical solution, Lasso, random forest and gradient boosting. The main metrics for assessing the performance of models are RMSE, MAE and RÂ².
